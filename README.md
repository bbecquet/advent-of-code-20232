# Advent of code 2023

My participation to [Advent of Code 2023 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Tools: Vanilla Node JS + some [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) for functional goodness.

For each entry `xx`:

- `xx.txt`: the input file
- `xxa.mjs`: code for first part
- `xxb.mjs`: code for second part

To run: `node xxa.mjs`
